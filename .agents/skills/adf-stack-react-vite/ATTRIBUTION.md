`packs/react-vite` was distilled from four MIT-licensed skills in [affaan-m/ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC)
v2.2.3, © 2026 Affaan Mustafa:

- `skills/react-patterns` — derived state, hooks discipline, state-placement decision tree, form and data-fetching
  decisions
- `skills/react-testing` — query priority, `userEvent`, MSW setup, hook tests, `axe` assertions, coverage shape
- `skills/vite-patterns` — config, `VITE_` env exposure rules, proxy, build pitfalls, barrel-file and pre-bundle issues
- `skills/e2e-testing` — page object structure, Playwright config, flake causes

Changes made to fit the ADF pack contract: split into three reference files with one owning concern each, tool commands
moved into the PROJECT values table, a project-specific review checklist added, and the following upstream defects
corrected:

- `react-patterns` and `react-testing` mix Next.js Server Components into React guidance — dropped: a Vite app has no
  RSC, and shipping both in one file made the agent apply `"use server"` in a client-only app.
- `e2e-testing` waits on `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` and locates by `data-testid` first — replaced with web-first
  assertions and role/label locators, since `networkidle` is unreliable on any app that polls or streams.
- Both React skills link to `../../rules/react/*.md`, which does not exist in the upstream tree; the rules are inlined
  here instead.
